### Things to keep in mind

- Please do not edit the icon design file. If you have suggestions about the icon, please open an issue.

### Testing your local changes

Before opening a pull request, please make sure your changes don't break things.

Start an HTTP sever in the directory of the project:

~~~
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000
~~~

Install the extension on your browser and navigate to `localhost:9000/test.html` to check that all strings are spelled correctly.

### Submitting the PR

When the coding is done and you‚Äôve finished testing your changes, you are ready to submit the PR to the [main repo](https://github.com/alexaubry/BestCode). Some best practices are:

- Use a descriptive title
- Link the issues that are related to your PR in the body
